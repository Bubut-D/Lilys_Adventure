# Lilys-Adventure
## Description
   This project is a 2D game made using the Unity Engine for an internship case. I was given
a PDF file that contained the details of what type of game the company wanted from me, which 
was a hidden objects game (which I have never thought about how to make before).
   The game is composed of 3 scenes: The main menu, the level with the gameplay and the end 
screen.
   The main menu includes a start button, a settings button which opens a settings menu where you can
adjust the background music and sound effects volumes and an exit button which takes you out of the game.
   The actual level takes place in a single location, a flower garden, which the player traverses with
their mouse where there are 8 "Magical Objects" and 7 "Wrong Objects" scattered around. 
   The UI consists of a few components:
   * An inventory on the bottom of the screen that has the shadow images of the "Magical Objects" in
each slot which helps you identify the "Magical Objects", once you find a "Magical Object" and drag it
onto the inventory the object that was being dragged fades away and the corresponding shadow fades, a
happy jingle plays and reveals the object in the inventory. The "Magical Objects" will sparkle after
some time which will help the player differentiate the object types from each other. If you drag the
"Wrong Items" then the object will return to its original place and a bad jingle will play. If you
don't drag the objects to the inventory then they will return to their original place.
   * A fairy named Lily on the bottom left of the screen, who is the titular character of this game,
but she cannot be controlled by the player, she only emotes when you drag the objects onto the inventory,
if you drag the "Magical Objects" onto the inventory then she jumps with joy, when you win the game she 
gets really cheerful aswell, if you drag the "Wrong Objects" then she gets angry.
   * An exit button on the top left which takes you back to the main menu.
   * Two gray bars with arrows in them both on the top and the bottom, when the mouse hovers over
these bars the camera moves accordingly.
   When the player finds every single "Magical Object" and drags them onto the inventory Lily will 
jump and twirl, the garden will start to glow and you will have won the game. The game will then transition 
to the end screen.
   The end screen has some text, a replay button and an exit button.
## Assets
   Most of the assets were from The Unity Asset Store, some were found on the internet, some of them
were made from images created by the Microsoft Copilot and some of those images were changed by me via Photopea.
## Final Thoughts	
   I had fun with this project, learned some new things along the process as well and felt satisfied with
what I accomplished even though I had to make this in three days (I had seven days to make it but if i did i
might have been late to give the internship documents to my University :D).
